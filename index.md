## Human Rights Ontology

This is my master thesis project at the Department of Computer and Systems Sciences (DSV) at Stockholm University.

The goal of the project is to design an ontology that will be a tool for human rights groups that are building databases for documenting human rights violations. In short, an ontology is a shared data model that can be reused and adapted for many different systems and applications. Ontologies are valuable for database designing because they reduce the need of reinventing the wheel. They provide a map of what lies ahead, and design patterns that can be reused. 

The Human Rights Ontology will be: 

- **Comprehensive**. It will cover most aspects of human rights violations documentation
- **Flexible**. It will as much as possible be built on different modules that can be put together so that they fit the needs of different organisations. 
- **Editable**. Made accessbile with tools that make it easy for others to adapte it to their needs. 
- **Open**. Published with an open licence. 
- **Based on existing models**. For instance, [HURIDOCS' events standard formats](https://huridocs.org/resource-library/monitoring-and-documenting-human-rights-violations/events-standard-formats/) and different UN Human Rights public databases.

Here you can read more about other benefits of ontologies: [Explaining Ontologies to Your Boss](https://ontology-explained.com/2020/explain-boss/).

### An ontology example

So what does an ontology look like? They can take many forms, but here is an example from the flood response communication domain (copied from [Khantong & Ahmad 2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13740-019-00110-6), Figure 1)

![8_PDFsam_Khantong-Ahmad2020_Article_AnOntologyForSharingAndManagin_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80962856/155881956-43a27300-b1bf-4242-8a1c-49e4a9f17977.gif)

Of course, a diagram like this is far from self-explanatory. That is why the finished ontology will be accompanied by **a manual about how to use it** for developing data models for concrete applications. 

## Collaboration
The project is done in collaboration with HURIDOCS, an NGO that helps human rights groups gather, organise and use information. My contact person there is [Kristin Antin](https://huridocs.org/about/staff/), knowledge collaboration lead. My supervisor at Stockholm University is Associate Professor [Martin Henkel](https://www.su.se/english/profiles/mhenk-1.182179).

## Participate!
During the project, I will ask human rights workers to give inputs to the requirements of the Human Rights Ontology. When the ontology is finished, there will be an opportunity for some of the participants to have tailored data models developed for them, as a form of demonstration of the ontology. If you are interested in participating, please don’t hesitate to contact me!

## About me
I am studying the [master’s programme in Strategic Information Systems Management](https://www.su.se/english/search-courses-and-programmes/sslio-1.413332) at the Department of Computer and Systems Sciences (DSV) at Stockholm University. Previously I have mostly worked with communications, international development cooperation and human rights monitoring, for among others UN Human Rights and the Colombia Project of Peace Brigades International (PBI).
