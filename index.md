## Human Rights Ontology

This is my master thesis project at the Department of Computer and Systems Sciences (DSV) at Stockholm University.

The goal of the project is to design an ontology that will be a tool for human rights groups that are building databases for documenting human rights violations. In short, an ontology is a shared data model that can be reused in many different systems and applications. 

The Human Rights Ontology will be: 

- Comprehensive. It will cover most aspects of human rights violations documentation
- Flexible. It will be built on different modules that can be put together so that they fit the needs of different organisations. 
- Open and editable.

In other words, it should be useful for most human rights groups. Ontologies are valuable for database designing because they reduce the need of reinventing the wheel. They provide a map of what lies ahead, and patterns that can be reused. 

Here you can read more about the benefits of ontologies: [Explaining Ontologies to Your Boss](https://ontology-explained.com/2020/explain-boss/)

Alongside the ontology, there will be a manual for how to use it for developing data models for concrete applications. 

## Collaboration
The project is done in collaboration with HURIDOCS, an NGO that helps human rights groups gather, organise and use information. My contact person there is [Kristin Antin](https://www.su.se/english/profiles/mhenk-1.182179). My supervisor at Stockholm University is [Martin Henkel](https://www.su.se/english/profiles/mhenk-1.182179).

## Participate!
During the project, I will ask human rights workers to give inputs to the requirements of the Human Rights Ontology. When the ontology is finished, there will be an opportunity for some of the participants to have tailored data models developed for them, as a form of demonstration of the ontology. If you are interested in participating, please don’t hesitate to **contact me**!

## About me
I am studying the [master’s programme in Strategic Information Systems Management](https://www.su.se/english/search-courses-and-programmes/sslio-1.413332) at the Department of Computer and Systems Sciences (DSV) at Stockholm University. Previously I have mostly been working with communications, international cooperation and human rights monitoring, for among others UN Human Rights, the Swedish Fellowship of Reconciliation (SweFOR) and the Colombia Project of Peace Brigades International (PBI).
