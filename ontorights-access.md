## Access Full_OntoRights
OntoRights exists in two versions: Full OntoRights and Easy Ontorights. Both can be accessed either as static websites or as Visual Paradigm projects. Additionally, there is Basic OntoRights, which is rather a pedagocical tool drawn with the informal notation used in HURIDOCS' [Community Rescource](https://huridocs.org/community-resources/designing-your-conceptual-data-model/).
